## Overview:

This project features a Single Address Decoder PCB Circuit, designed to decode a specific address and activate a corresponding output. It's commonly used in digital electronics for memory addressing, bus systems, and other applications requiring selective activation based on an address input.

## Components:

1. Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
2. Integrated Circuits (ICs)
3. Resistors
4. Capacitors
5. LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes)
6. Header pins
7. Power source (battery)

## Setup:

1. **Hardware:**
   - Assemble the components according to the PCB layout and schematic diagram.
   - Solder the components onto the PCB, ensuring correct polarity and connections.
   - Connect the power source to the PCB.

2. **Software:**
   - Eagle Software.

## Usage:

1. Apply power to the circuit.
2. Input the desired address to the address pins.
3. The corresponding output LED will be activated if the input address matches the decoder's programmed address.
4. Test different addresses to verify the functionality of the decoder circuit.
